# Transfer Learning to play a game using a webcam and Tensorflow.js

This project is built to show how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer learning.

To achieve this, I have used a pretrained MobileNet model and train another model using an internal mobilenet activation to predict 4 different classes from the webcam defined by the user.
